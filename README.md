Retail RFM Analysis Project
Overview
This project is focused on performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on retail data to segment customers and identify key patterns in their purchasing behavior. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, making extensive use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into customer segmentation, enabling the development of targeted marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement and retention. By understanding the different segments within the customer base, businesses can tailor their approach to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains transaction records from a retail setting, including purchase dates, amounts, and customer identifiers. Please note that for confidentiality reasons, the actual dataset is not included in this repository.

Features
RFM Analysis: Calculation of recency, frequency, and monetary values to segment customers.
Data Visualization: Graphical representation of the analysis results to identify trends and patterns.
Customer Segmentation: Identification of distinct customer groups based on their RFM scores.
